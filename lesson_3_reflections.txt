When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  -To share my work with others and also to access my work from any place where an internet connection is available

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	We might change anytime. Automatic updation may lead to incomplete files being in your repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork:
		Fork is used to clone on github, for copying a repository from another user to your account so that you can make changes

	Clone:
		Clone is used to get the copy of the repository hosted in github to your account.

	Branches:
		To add a new feature, without breaking the working version of your product i.e to experiment or for a bug fix
