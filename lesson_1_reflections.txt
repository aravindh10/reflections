How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It gave the lines that were modified and we can focus more on the subset of lines instead of the whole file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	We can know all the changes made and so if one version doesn't work, it'll be easy to revert back to older version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	Pros: 
		Can have control over commits
		Commit when it is necessary
		Give comments for easier understanding in future
	Cons:
		Probably forget
		Needed to figure out right time
